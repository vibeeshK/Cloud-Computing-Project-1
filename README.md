Introduction: Most people would assume that rural areas (areas with a very low population density) have a large number of households that earn less than 10k. But could it be the same for suburban areas as well? Densely populated areas have a large number of "rich" households but poverty is rampant in those cities too. We are going to analyze this in the notebook.

Hypothesis- Congressional districts with a high population density have a larger ratio of households earning more than 200K AND less than 10k in comparison with districts that have a lower population density.
